# Recommendations for Image Handling

Many existing site generators make it easy for you to add images to your sites using special short codes which trigger the image processing to re-size and/or create multiple variations of images, resulting in a nice html img tags with the correct srcset etc. While this is conveninent for sure, and you can achieve this using Airfry, Airfry recommends against doint this, as it breaks the first commandment of Airfry:

Rebuilds should be fast!

There are much better ways to process and include images on your Airfry generated site [here](/docs/integration/images/).
